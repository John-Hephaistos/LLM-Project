is rare that a movie truly moves me  but  Shall We Dance   accomplished that with grace to spare  Gentle humor mixed in with occasional subtle agony made this easily one of the best experiences of my movie viewing history  It left me with a quiet sense of exultation  but with a small touch of sadness mixed in  br    br   And the dancing  oh yes  the dancing  Even if you are not a lover of the art  or can t put one foot in front of another  the steps displayed here will take your breath away  and make you want to sign up for classes as fast as you can  It was absolutely enchanting  even the parts that show Sugiyama s  touchingly portrayed by Koji Yakusho  stilted steps when he was first learning to dance were lovely in a humorous  child like way  And yet  this film was not entirely about dancing  but more about the subtleties of human behavior and feelings  We witness a shy man learning to express his repressed feelings through dance  a beautiful dance instructor rediscovering her love for the art  and the personal growth of every member of the wonderful supporting cast  br    br   Beauty  Pain  Emotion  All the love and little agonies of life are here  expressed with the delicate feeling of a fine Japanese watercolor painting combined with the emotional strength and grace of the culture  br    br   \",\n          \"It seems that Dee Snyder ran out of ideas halfway through the script  The second half of the movie is basically just a rehash of the first  which makes the film very boring  To sum up  Cop s daughter is suckered into party via chatroom where she is sexually molested tortured by psychopath  played by Snider   Cop rescues her  psychopath is put in therapy jail  Psychopath is released four years later and the whole thing is played out AGAIN  Within all this are many unexplained plot elements  Why was  Captain Howdy  psycho in the first place  What s with the one time personality detour to bible thumper  How does he kidnap all the adults and manage to sew their mouths shut without a struggle  And perhaps the biggest unsolved mystery of all    how does a 6 2  man with pink hair hide himself completely behind a 5 6  average build woman  These are just some of the questions I had watching this film  br    br   It seems that Snyder was trying to make some kind of commentary on a  the  dangers  of online chatrooms  b  the hypocrisy of Christian sexual mores  and c  the effect our twisted puritanical society has on us as individuals  If that is so  he failed  The movie is just too poorly done to entertain  never mind convey social messages  The torture scenes are stupid and boring  bordering on silly  especially when Snyder goes into one of his  pain and death  monologues   and everything else is just plain dumb  The  call tracing  scene is really lame    when are the cops gonna get caller ID and  69  The young partner of the main cop character is particularly awful    he shouldn t be working as an actor  basically  And the audio in the final showdown scene is really poor  I guess they couldn t afford two boom mikes  br    br   The rest of the acting is not awful but it s not good either  The cop is pretty one note  and his detached quality is not quite believable  Dee Snyder is actually not too bad  but he snarls and sneers way too much  Robert Englund  who deserves way better  puts in a somewhat amusing performance of a hypocritical redneck  If you re a big Robert Englund fan the movie is probably worth seeing just for him  Everyone else is forgettable  br    br   In conclusion  we ve seen all these plot elements done before and done better  in films like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS  HELLRAISER  and TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE  I suggest you rent one of those instead of watching this turkey  3 10  br    br   \",\n          \"This is the best of Shelley Duvall s high quality  Faerie Tale Theatre  series  The ugly stepsisters are broadway quality comedy relief  and Eve Arden is the personification of wicked stepmotherhood  Jennifer Beals does an excellent job as a straight Cinderella  especially in the garden scene with Matthew Broderick s Prince Charming  Jean Stapleton plays the fairy godmother well  although I m not sure I liked the  southern lady  characterization with some of the lines  Steve Martin s comedy relief as the Royal Orchestra Conductor is quintessential Martin  but a tiny bit

should have been locked up in storage along with a number of other unfinished Welles  projects no one has ever seen  Now we know why  To add additional insult to prior injury  the appalling English language dubbing by amateur America dubbing actors and even the great man himself only heightens all the sloppy mistakes in story telling and construction  It s as if every weekend some good hearted Spanish soul gave Orson a few pesos  a 35mm camera and some short ends of negative film left over from some other production and told Welles to drive out to the Spanish countryside and just keeping shooting anything and everything until the film stock ran out  It s true that if Orson had really shaped this film himself instead the notorious Jesus Franco  he might have thrown out 85  of what he shot  but we will never know  As Welles never took the time to edit his own work here  and somewhere along the way he or his heirs sanctioned someone else to do so  he is not entirely blameless for the debacle  Those who wish to prove that in his early days Welles was the luckiest of young men because he surrounded himself with the likes of John Houseman  Herman Mankewiecz  Greg Toland  Bernard Hermann and Robert Wise need no better proof of his adult inadequacies than this mess of a film  In his sad old age Welles was capable of doing anything when he needed a few bucks or pesos  including selling his artistic soul  The devil certainly got his due with this one \",\n          \"Though this series only ran a season  it has stayed with me for 20 years  It was by far and above my all time favorite cartoon ever  I would give nearly anything to have it on DVD or whatever format I can get  If you find any means of seeing this series I suggest you take full advantage  This series was the first one  in my opinion  that had a truly coherent storyline that spanned across multiple episodes  It also made me truly care about the characters and what happened to them  Heck the character Goose actually scared me sometimes  He was just that odd at the time  Also the leader of the group reminds me a lot of a combination of Clint Eastwood Tommy Lee Jones  If anyone has any way of contacting the creator holder of the rights to the series and can get them put out on DVD please by all means do so   \",\n          \"This movie was one of the worst I ve ever seen  it did not left out a single clichee one could imagine about a Hollywood so called Thriller  The protagonist is a loving father   a private investigator who is engaged in a special task  finding out if a suspected  snuff  movie is real  br    br   Certainly  he get s involved deeper   deeper  smeary pornoshops  run by mexicans    sex theatres are his field of investigation as he s searching for the murderers of the woman in the  snuff  movie  Assisted by a  smart   he read a book  sexshop employee  he s catching up with a murderous bondage film producer and his personal perverts who are responsible for the film       and what do you expect  They are portrayed as the simple evil  no need for explanations  backgrounds  history  they are the bad ones  and he s the purifier  Boom  Killer of the killers  End of film  Is it that bad  Yes  I m afraid so  br    br   Ironically   machine   the mega pervert who did the killing  is even pointing at his ridiculous character  In the last scene  our hero forces  machine  to put off his leather mask  yep  of course he s wearing one  and recognizes that  machine  looks just like the normal 08 15 guy from the street  Then  machine  says   blablabla I m not a monster  my parents never abused me  I had a nice childhood  I just love to do what I do   br    br   I just love to kill people  Yeah  sure   everybody loves killing people   Bender   It s not only the total lack of character what made this film so boring  it s also it s ugly  I have to kill these people  attitude which makes you sick  In one scene  our hero has tied up one of the killers and tries to shoot him   but he can t  So what does he do  He calls the mother of the killed woman  says that her child is killed and asks her whether she loved her child so much that she wishes to see the killers dead  The mother cries yes  she d love her child  he goes back to the tied killer and slaughters him  br    br   To come to the point  This film is breathing the foul air of lynchmob supporters  certainly the police does not play any role in it   moralizes in a ridiculous form against pornography  does not take it s characters serious and wastes your time with a stupid plot  Probably the only good thing about this film is that it does not try to pseudo psycho analyze     even that would be too much plot  br    br   Don t waste your time with this  br    br   \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\":
